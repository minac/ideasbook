Chapter 4 - Under the sea we breathe

Under the sea. Of course we had to move to the oceans. The unavoidability was almost as clear pollution itself. When the trash became so much on land that that we started making hills on top of hills of it, then the land subsided and stopped producing any kind of food. That along with the earthquakes and volcanoes erupting all the time, meant that there were only two ways out, space and the sea. We would have gone to space for sure, and some even tried, only to report inadaptations that resulted in coming back to Earth or worse, staying out there and suffer. So we went to the sea. After all it's 70% of the Earth's surface and even with our consistent trashing it, there was still space at the bottom for us to build colonies. No, we did not delevop gills like mermaids or aquamen, that was only for the select few that had the money. The rest of us lived in domes. Huge domes at the bottom of the sea, mostly using the Earth's geowarmth to keep the minimum services and a small nuclear fusion core right in the middle of the dome. People complained in the beginning about the nuclear plant "so close to home", but when they saw that it was either that or death, they quickly changed their minds. Nuclear did not only help with heating and life support (O2 was cheaper to fetch from the water, than from the surface heavily polluted air), it also powered all electrical devices inside. Those devices, without which we no longer know how to live.
